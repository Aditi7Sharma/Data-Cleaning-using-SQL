# Data-Cleaning-using-SQL
Cleaned and preprocessed messy datasets using SQL to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats, and created clean tables for analysis. Prepared the dataset for further visualization and reporting.
In this project, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing on raw and messy datasets using SQL queries to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis. The project involved:

Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data formats.

Standardizing and transforming data using SQL functions.

Creating clean tables and views for easy querying.

Performing preliminary aggregations and summaries to validate data quality.

Preparing the dataset for further analysis, reporting, and dashboard creation.

Skills & Tools: SQL, Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Queries, Aggregations
